This is a hybrid mobile application done with Adobe PhoneGap. This is kind of a review &amp; feedback application for a specific hotel or a restaurant.
Create a database. Then create a php file to send form data to the database, or use ajax and jason to pass form data to the database.
Finally use a dashboard to display those data and statics.
